# Full-Stack Note-Taking Application

This is a complete, full-stack note-taking web application featuring a secure, modern authentication system and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing user-specific notes. The project is designed with a clean, responsive user interface and a robust back-end API.

---

## Features Implemented

- **Dual Authentication System**
  - **Email & OTP**: A passwordless flow where users receive a One-Time Password to their email for authentication. Includes a timed "Resend OTP" functionality.
  - **Google OAuth 2.0**: Seamless one-click sign-in and sign-up using a Google account.
- **Secure API**: The back-end API is protected using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can only access and manage their own notes.
- **Note Management**: Once authenticated, users can create, view, and delete their personal notes on a clean dashboard interface.
- **Responsive UI**: The front-end is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Asynchronous Feedback**: The user interface provides clear feedback for all operations, including loading indicators for ongoing API requests and toast notifications for success or error messages.
- **Persistent Login**: The application maintains the user's session, automatically redirecting logged-in users to the dashboard.

cd [Your-Repo-Name]
2. Back-End Server Setup
Navigate to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a new file named .env in the server/ directory. Copy the structure below and fill it with your own credentials.

.env.example for Server:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=
JWT_SECRET=

# Credentials for sending OTP emails via Gmail
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=

# Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
How to get the values:

Key	Description	Source
MONGO_URI	Your connection string for the MongoDB database	MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
JWT_SECRET	A long, random, secret string used to sign JSON Web Tokens	Create your own secret string
EMAIL_USER	The Gmail account from which OTP emails will be sent	Your Gmail account
EMAIL_PASS	The 16-character App Password generated from your Google Account	Google Account Security Settings ‚Üí App Passwords
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID	The Client ID for your web application	Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET	The Client Secret for your web application	Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
CLIENT_URL	The URL of your front-end application (default: http://localhost:5173)	Manual setup

Run the server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
3. Front-End Client Setup
In a new terminal, navigate to the client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a new file named .env in the client/ directory. Copy the structure below and fill it with your Google Client ID.

.env.example for Client:

env
Copy code
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
How to get the value:

Key	Description	Source
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID	The same Client ID used for the backend. The VITE_ prefix is required by Vite.	Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials

Run the client:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Your application is now fully running locally.

Deployment
This application is configured for a single-service deployment on a platform like Render.

Build Command

bash
Copy code
npm install --prefix client && npm install --prefix server && npm run build --prefix client && npm run build --prefix server

Would you like me to also **add a "Project Structure" section** (showing `client/`, `server/`, and key files) to make the README more professional?

hey i am telling no all the info even all the steps in a single file


ChatGPT said:
Understood üëç You want all the details you gave me (features, stack, setup, .env details, deployment, everything) merged into one professional README.md file without splitting or skipping anything.
